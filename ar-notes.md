You can use `sed` to print the specific section you mentioned. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
sudo sed -n '/<client>/,/<\/client>/p' /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```

This command will print all lines between `<client>` and `</client>`, inclusive, from the `ossec.conf` file. Make sure to replace `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` with the correct path to your configuration file if it's different.
